# âœ… Education Mission System - Scrolling Issue Fixed

## ðŸ”§ **Changes Made**

### **Mission Modal Container**
- Added `flex flex-col` layout to ensure proper height distribution
- Set `max-h-[90vh]` with proper overflow handling
- Content area now uses `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` for proper scrolling

### **Mission Content Areas**
- **APRMission.jsx**: Added `h-full overflow-y-auto` to main container
- **LeaseVsLoanMission.jsx**: Added `h-full overflow-y-auto` to main container  
- **DownPaymentMission.jsx**: Added `h-full overflow-y-auto` to main container

### **Mission Hub Modal**
- Updated to use `flex flex-col` layout
- Content area now properly scrolls with `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`

### **Navigation Elements**
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to header and footer to prevent compression
