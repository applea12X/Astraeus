# ü§ñ AI Shopping Assistant - Like Cluely!

## What It Does

The AI Shopping Assistant is an intelligent floating chatbot that guides users to external websites (Toyota.com, insurance sites, dealer locators, etc.) with personalized recommendations - just like Cluely!

## How It Works

### 1. **Smart URL Generation**
Based on the user's profile, selected vehicle, and financial information, it pre-configures URLs to:
- Toyota.com inventory search
- Insurance quote comparison sites (TheZebra, Progressive, etc.)
- Toyota Financial Services calculators
- Nearby dealer locators
- Trade-in value estimators (KBB, Edmunds)

### 2. **Gemini AI Conversational Intelligence**
Users can ask natural questions like:
- "Help me find this car on Toyota.com"
- "Where can I get the best insurance quotes?"
- "Show me nearby dealers"
- "How do I calculate my monthly payments?"

The AI understands context and provides:
- **Personalized advice** based on their financial profile
- **Direct links** to relevant resources
- **Explanations** of why they should visit each site

### 3. **Quick Action Links**
Pre-configured buttons for instant access:
- üöó **Find on Toyota.com** - Pre-filled search
- üõ°Ô∏è **Get Insurance Quotes** - Compare providers
- üí∞ **Financing Calculator** - Toyota Financial Services
- üìç **Find Dealers** - Nearby locations
- üìà **Trade-In Value** - KBB estimates

## Where It Appears

‚úÖ **Saturn Results Page** - After selecting a vehicle
‚úÖ **Jupiter Purchase Plan** - During purchase planning

6. **User asks: "Where can I get insurance?"**
